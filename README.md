### This is a basic machine learning and deep learning based Diabetes prediction app.

<hr>

### This was our solution project for UGC Hackathon by upGrad Campus in which we secured 2nd position!

## Details :

### This is primarily based on the application of machine learning, which is intended to be used in remote and underserved areas.

## Overview :

### In today's world, there is a severe shortage of doctors, particularly in India. Many people are suffering as a result of not receiving proper medical care. In addition, many cases arise that lead to death as a result of a lack of timely medical checkup.
### To deal with all of these issues, this app was created.

## Creators :
-Abhinandan Khurana 
-Vidushi Katare 
-Pranjal Bhalla 

## How to use?

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository - 
<code> git clone https://github.com/Abhinandan-Khurana/Daijobu.git </code>
<br>
<code> 2. pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
<br>
<code> 3. python3 app.py </code>

## NOTE: 
### This application was created in just 6 hours, and we intend to expand on it in the future.
### Many extra files may be present because those are features that we are either working on for the next version or that are not working properly, so we removed the integration with the app.
### However, the app will function normally as a Diabetes prediction app.
